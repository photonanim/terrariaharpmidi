# terrariaharpmidi
Plays MIDIs on the Terraria harp, in an insanely roundabout way

Insufferably horrible, don't use.

I first converted .midi files to .csv using midicsv, and then screwed around with it in order to make it function.

If you try inputting your own .csv from midicsv, it probably won't work just because it's that bad...
